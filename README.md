## News App-Full Stack Project Brief

You have been tasked with building a web application to allow  a local news company to upload the latest Scottish news.

They want to be able to:
#### For backend, users should be able to:
- [ ] Add, Edit and Remove Journalists
- [ ] Add, Edit and Remove Articles

#### For the front end, users should be able to:

- [ ] View a list of articles, ordered by date. (Newest first!)
- [ ] Filter articles based on catagory
- [ ] Click through to the full story .

Each Article might have a headline, summary paragraph, 
and the full story along with the journalist who wrote it - and any other fields you want to add.)

### Project Extensions
- Search for articles where the title includes a particular search term
- Filter articles by journalist
- Filter articles by category, which can be added by SGNN
- Track how many times an article has been read, and display a list of most popular articles
- Paginate your article list - display a certain number of articles per page, with a page number,
  and navigation to go to the next and previous page
  
  ### TO RUN APP LOCALLY...

  - npm run build (in client directory)
  - npm start (in client directory)
  
  - open server folder in IDE (We used IntelliJ)
  - run server
